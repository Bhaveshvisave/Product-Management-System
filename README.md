# Product Management System

**Product Management System** is a simple web application for managing products and categories. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, manage product categories, and view paginated product listings. This project uses **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQL Server** to provide a full-stack solution for managing product data.

The system is designed to be user-friendly and supports features like server-side pagination for large data sets, making it easy to manage products without performance issues.

## Features
- **Product Management**: 
  - Add, Edit, Delete, and View Products.
  - Products can be linked to a specific category.
- **Category Management**: 
  - Create and manage categories.
  - Assign products to categories for better organization.
- **Pagination**: 
  - Server-side pagination ensures that products are loaded in chunks based on the page number and page size, improving the performance of large product lists.
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - The application uses Bootstrap to provide a responsive layout, ensuring it works well across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core MVC for web development.
- **Database**: SQL Server and Entity Framework Core for ORM and data management.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for styling and responsive design.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for code management and collaboration.
